## product_alias
Adds support to configure/add aliases on products so products can be found more easily and with multiple terms.
This support works on any search operation so by default also adds support for the Odoo webshop.
Aliases are configurable on the product itself:

You can view/edit/manage all aliases from Sales > Configuration > Product Aliases:

They are only editable, creatable and deletable by sales administrators. Normal users can only read them.
